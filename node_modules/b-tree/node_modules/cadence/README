Structure

`./cadence.js` ~ Outgoing Cadence library. Used in production, but performance
is not what it should be. Cadence Redux forgoes the overloading of the `async`
function with special parameters, adds functionality using the `async` function
as a namespace for special operations like `async.forEach` and `async.map`.

`./redux.js` ~ Build to this. It is the bomb.

`./_redux.js` ~ The previous version of Cadence Redux. Used for benchmarking
incremental performance improvements.
